The rivalry between Atari and Intellivision, which began in the late 1970s and continued into the early 1980s, significantly shaped the early home video game industry. Here are some important points to note:
### Historical Context and Marketing Strategies
- **Atari 2600 (1977)**: In 1977, Atari released the 2600 (originally the Atari VCS), which became one of the most successful early home video game consoles. Its extensive game library and innovative use of microprocessor technology enabled it to become a market leader.
- **Intellivision (1980)**: Mattel introduced the Intellivision in 1980, positioning itself as a direct competitor to the Atari 2600. It offered better graphics and sound features and was intended to excel in sports and educational games.
- **Marketing and Branding**: Both companies invest heavily in marketing. Atari used its early market presence and iconic games like "Space Invaders" to maintain its dominance, while Intellivision targets the perceived technical superiority of its console in its advertising.
### Technical Comparisons and Updates
- **Graphics and Sound**: The Intellivision had better graphics and sounds compared to the Atari 2600. It used a 16-bit processor that was ahead of its time. The Atari 2600 had an 8-bit processor.
- **Controls and Gameplay**: Intellivision introduced a unique controller with a number pad and side buttons to allow for more complex game interaction. However, its controller has sometimes been criticized for being less intuitive than the Atari controller.
### Software and Game Libraries
- **Exclusive Titles**: Both systems had exclusive titles that appealed to different demographics. Atari's library included hits like "Pac-Man" and "Asteroids," while Intellivision offered titles like "Astrosmash" and "BurgerTime.
- **Third Party Developers**: Activision, the first third party game developer, originally developed games for the Atari 2600, setting the trend for other developers and expanding the Atari game library.
### Influence and Legacy
- **Market Share**: Atari initially maintained a significant market share, but the arrival of the Intellivision and aggressive marketing allowed it to capture a significant portion of the market. Both consoles were popular in the early 1980s, but Atari's larger game library kept it slightly ahead.
- **1983. Video game crash of 1983**: Both Atari and Intellivision contributed to the video game crash of 1983, due in part to market saturation and lack of quality control in game production. That collapse caused a temporary decline in the home video game market until the arrival of the Nintendo NES in 1985.
### Conclusion
The rivalry between Atari and Intellivision was crucial for the growth and development of the video game industry. It spurred innovation in game design, marketing strategies, and technological development. Although the dynamics of the market have changed dramatically since then, the legacy of this competition can be seen in the strategies of today's game companies and the emphasis on hardware features and software quality..
